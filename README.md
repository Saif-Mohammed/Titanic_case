### Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

### Installations
* Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* Anaconda.

### Code
Code is provided in Titanic_case4.ipynb

### Executive summary of research
Female passengers survived more than male ones. 1st class passengers survived more than 2nd and 3d, and 2nd more than the 3d. Crew members were possibly those who had Fare == 0 were male, did not have any family members, most of them did not have cabin numbers and they had 6.7% chance of survival. Third of age data is missing therefore it would be harder to make conclusions based on age. This sample seems to be resresentative of the total population based on its size and random distribution where percentages of male, female, passenger classes are similar to total population ones.
